# Folder structure

We have a docs folder which has documentation on how the project works for ease of use.     
The skyHealthProject folder is where the project is hosted, it has another skyHealthProject folder which is used for website wide settings and such.       
The core, quiz, stats and user folders are apps. A project can have multiple apps, and as such allows us to keep code modular.      
     
The core app - Iqra Shah - Home, login, signup pages 
The Quiz app = Barket - Quiz page      
The stats app - Muhammad Ravat - Statistics page     
The user app - User profile/dashboard
